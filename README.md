# IPL-SCORE-PREDICTION

IPL Score Prediction with Live Weather Integration 🌦️
Predict the final score of an IPL match using machine learning and real-time weather data!

This project combines the thrill of cricket with the power of machine learning. By analyzing match details and live weather conditions, the system predicts a cricket team's final score using a trained neural network. With a clean frontend and a responsive backend, the system offers a seamless prediction experience.

Overview
This system predicts the projected final score of a team during an IPL match based on:

Batting team

Bowling team

Overs completed

Current runs/wickets

Run rate

Live weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)

It uses a Neural Network (3–4 hidden layers) model trained on historical IPL datasets and weather data to generate predictions in real-time via a beautiful web interface.

 FEATURES

 Predicts team score dynamically based on inputs

 Uses live weather data API (OpenWeatherMap)

 Real-time predictions with interactive UI

 Neural Network-based regression model

 Stylish frontend with React and Bootstrap

 Integrated Flask API for prediction backend
